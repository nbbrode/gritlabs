## Welcome to Grit Labs

> **Build with clarity. Reason with structure. Document what matters.**

Grit Labs is a structured approach to designing, building, and evolving systems—across teams, technologies, and timelines.  
It isn’t just a philosophy. It’s a practical system built around interfaces, documentation, and the traceable consequences of change.

This site collects the core patterns, workflows, and interfaces that define how disciplined teams think and build. It is not a changelog. It is not a product site. It is a working lens for making intent and implementation align.

## What Grit Labs Makes Possible

Most teams rely on scattered tools and tribal knowledge. Grit Labs replaces that with a system of structured interfaces—linking knowledge, behavior, and integration.

#### With Grit Labs:

1. ✅ **You can report developer effort by problem, feature, or product**  
   Case studies capture real work in structured documents—meaning every hour logged is instantly traceable to business context.

2. 🧪 **You can generate regression tests automatically**  
   Each feature request defines its own test cases. Product-wide test suites can be regenerated on demand, organized by interface.

3. 📚 **You can say “the docs are already done”**  
   Documentation isn’t a trailing artifact. It defines behavior before implementation begins. Nothing gets released until the scope of work is clear.

4. 🧭 **You can define and evolve a shared language with traceable consequences**  
   Every term, interface, and expectation is explicit. When you change the language, you change the system—and that change is versioned, reviewable, and intentional.
